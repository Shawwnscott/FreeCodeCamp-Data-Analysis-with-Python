# FreeCodeCamp - Data Analysis With Python

Data Analysis has been around for a long time. But up until a few years ago, developers practiced it using expensive, closed-source tools like Tableau. But recently, Python, SQL, and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

These are all the projects required for FreeCodeCamp's Data Analysis With Python Certification.
